 * A team leader is an hourly paid production worker that leads a small team. In
 * addition to hourly pay, team leaders earn a fixed monthly bonus. Team leaders
 * are required to attend a minimum number of hours of training per year. Design
 * a TeamLeader class that extends the ProductionWorker class. The TeamLeader
 * class should have fields for the monthly bonus amount (bonus:double), the
 * required number of training hours (requiredTraining:int), and the number of
 * training hours that the tam leader has attended (attendedTraining:int). Write
 * a no-arg constructor and a complete constructor (eg- TeamLeader(name, id,
 * hireDate, shift, hourlyRate, bonus, requiredTraining, attendedTraining)) and
 * the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class.
