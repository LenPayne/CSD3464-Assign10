 * A shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition
 * to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift
 * meets production goals. Design a ShiftSupervisor class that extends the
 * Employee class. The ShiftSupervisor class should have a field that holds the
 * annual salary (salary:double) and a field that holds the annual production
 * bonus (bonusEarned:double) that a shift supervisor has earned. Write a no-arg
 * constructor and a complete constructor (eg- ShiftSupervisor(name, id,
 * hireDate, salary, bonusEarned)) and the appropriate accessor and mutator
 * methods for the class.
