/*
 * Write a class named ProductionWorker that extends the Employee class. The
 * ProductionWorker class should have fields to hold the following information:
 *   1) Shift (shift:int) 
 *   2) Hourly pay rate (hourlyRate:double) 
 * The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift field will 
 * be an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day 
 * shift is shift 1 and the night shift is shift 2. Write a no-arg constructor, 
 * and a complete constructor (eg- ProductionWorker(name, id, hireDate, shift, 
 * hourlyRate)) and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class.
